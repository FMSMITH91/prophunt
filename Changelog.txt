*Fixed*
-Wait for round to start till players spawns in on team props or hunters.
-Round count not showing when dead/spectating.
-When players enter server they are assigned to TEAM_UNASSIGNED instead of TEAM_SPECTATOR.
-When player tries to vote for map change the player sends to chat "rtv". (Not really a bug just didn't want to to use "MapVote - Fretta-like Map Voting" just yet.)
-Hunters win when last hunter on team kills self.
-When hunters or Props kills self then it will go against team score.
-On some maps as a hunter while blinded, screen will spaaz out.
