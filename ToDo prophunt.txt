This is a list of things that need to be worked on. If you know a fix for any of these or found a bug then please open a new issue.

*Fixes*
-Score not being kept/transferred between teams. (Working on this)
-prop_door_rotating has Door model (models/props_c17/door01_left.mdl) with no door_options! Verify that SKIN is valid, and has a corresponding options block in the model QC file
-Very rearly a hunter will spawn not blinded and is able to move around and kill props.
-player dies when switching to spectator.
-When the round limit ends first players still respawn for round "11" but yet map vote starts also.
-When the round ends, and someone kills a prop, just as it changes, as a hunter they get noclip. (Needs looking into.)


*Enhancements*
-Better ULX support. (Maybe add ranks to scoreboard)
-Add mute function to allow players to mute other players. (Currently being worked on?)
-Allow to give props a weapon at a certain time limit or give a weapon to last prop left to kill hunters.
-Add unstuck function.
-Add when 1 minute left in game props will taunt every few seconds.
-Adding MapVote - Fretta-like Map Voting (I'll do some testing first and if I like what I see then I'll update it)
